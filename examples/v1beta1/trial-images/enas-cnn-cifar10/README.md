# Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) Training Container

This is training container for the ENAS algorithm. It uses Keras convolutional neural
network and CIFAR-10 dataset to train the model.

To know more about using ENAS in Katib, check
[this guide](../../../../pkg/suggestion/v1beta1/nas/enas/).

Katib uses this training container in the [ENAS Experiments](../../nas/enas-gpu.yaml#L137-L148).
